# QA Gen

> A local and customizable web-based application for interactive learning and exam preparation. It lets you import your own multiple-choice questions from a text file and take interactive quizzes in a clean, modern interface. It was built for anyone who wants a straightforward way to practice and learn their material.

## Basic Features

* **Study Mode**: Get immediate, color-coded feedback after each answer.
* **Exam Mode**: Simulate a real test with a final grade revealed only at the end.
* **Explanations**: Get detailed explanations for any question by connecting to LLM provider (Ollama, OpenAI, Gemini, Perplexity).

## Getting Started
